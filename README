# pong

## Time
4/8 30min read spec, chose stack, setup repo, setup env, conceptual brainstorming
- git, vscode, pyenv, poetry, pygame, asyncio streams
5/8 10min wslg (linux guis in wsl2) only win insider, switching to c#
- monogame, async sockets
5/8 10min installed monogame vs extension, setup new repo, created first file layouts

## Conceptual brainstorming
client key press -> server -> broadcast new position -> client draws paddles
 - key press version will probably cause input lag, keeping local player position locally
server checks for collision -> broadcast ball position -> client draws ball
server checks for goal -> updates score -> resets ball
